Hi I'm Alex! Welcome to my GitHub pages site.
I like to use this site as a way to track technical projects that I undertake, both for personal and public record.

A lot of the time it will be HackTheBox challenges, and sometimes other technical activities like AWS home labbing, intro to technologies (like NeoVim) and other topics
I might also sometimes share photo's I've taken on holidays around Australia or overseas and write about my experience in these cultures.
Or I'll write about things that I've read that I find interesting, and might have interesting insight, or seek to delve further into certain topics.


Stay tuned!

If you'd like to reach out, I can be contacted at alex@nevin.com.au
